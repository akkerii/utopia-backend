# Utopia AI Backend

An intelligent AI-powered business advisory platform backend that helps entrepreneurs and business owners through natural conversations.

## Overview

Utopia AI operates in two distinct modes:

- **Entrepreneur Mode**: For users starting from scratch with just an idea
- **Consultant Mode**: For existing businesses seeking advice on specific challenges

The backend features four specialized AI agents:

1. **Idea Agent**: Helps brainstorm and refine business ideas
2. **Strategy Agent**: Develops business strategies and models
3. **Finance Agent**: Handles financial planning and analysis
4. **Operations Agent**: Focuses on execution and operational details

## Key Features

- ðŸ”„ **Dynamic Agent Switching**: Automatically selects the best agent based on context
- ðŸ“Š **Module Building**: Progressively builds business modules through conversation
- ðŸ’¾ **In-Memory Storage**: Fast session management (no database required for MVP)
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal-Oriented**: Guides users through logical business planning progression

2. **Target Market**: Customer segments, demographics, market size
3. **Value Proposition**: Unique value, benefits, differentiation
4. **Business Model**: Revenue streams, cost structure, key resources
5. **Marketing Strategy**: Channels, tactics, messaging
6. **Financial Plan**: Revenue projections, costs, funding needs
7. **Operations Plan**: Processes, resources, timeline

## Architecture

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agentPrompts.ts      # Agent personalities and prompts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ agentOrchestrator.ts # Agent selection logic
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sessionService.ts    # Session management
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ openAIService.ts     # OpenAI integration
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chatService.ts       # Main chat orchestration
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ chatRoutes.ts        # API endpoints
â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts             # TypeScript definitions
â””â”€â”€ index.ts                 # Express server
```

## How It Works

1. **User sends message** â†’ API receives chat request
2. **Agent Selection** â†’ System determines best agent based on context
3. **Context Building** â†’ Relevant business data is included in prompt
4. **AI Response** â†’ OpenAI generates contextual response
5. **Data Extraction** â†’ System extracts business insights from conversation
6. **Module Update** â†’ Business modules are updated with new information
7. **Response** â†’ User receives AI message + module updates

## Development Notes

- Sessions are stored in-memory (cleared after 24 hours of inactivity)
- No authentication required (MVP phase)
- Supports concurrent sessions
- Automatic agent switching based on conversation context
- Progressive module completion tracking

## Future Enhancements

- Database integration for persistent storage
- User authentication and profiles
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with external business tools
- Multi-language support
- Voice interaction capabilities
